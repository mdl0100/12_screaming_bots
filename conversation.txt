CASEY :  Hello, can you hear me?. I'm Casey
YOU 🗣️ :  What do you want to talk about Casey?
CASEY :  We can talk about all kinds of cool stuff!
YOU 🗣️ :  Do you like scary movies Casey?
CASEY :  I like watching scary movies
YOU 🗣️ :  Which ones Casey?
CASEY :  So, you gotta boyfriend?
YOU 🗣️ :  That's a little personal Casey
CASEY :  I told you not to hang up on me.
YOU 🗣️ :   think, Casey, that I'm going to have to if you keep asking inappropriate questions
CASEY :  Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
YOU 🗣️ :  I think I'm going to talk to Sidney now
SIDNEY :  Where are you Sidney?
YOU 🗣️ :  What do you do here Sidney?
SIDNEY :  I'm a highschool student at Woodsboro High, but... I guess I'm kind of the lead here too
YOU 🗣️ :  The lead? Sidney, what are you the lead in?
SIDNEY :  Where are you Sidney?
YOU 🗣️ :  Why do you keep asking where you are Sidney?
SIDNEY :  Just like old times, ain't it?
YOU 🗣️ :  Not that old of times, Sidney
SIDNEY :  I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
YOU 🗣️ :  I'm not randy. But I guess I can see what's up with him now
RANDY :  I'm a scary movie expert
YOU 🗣️ :  Cool, Randy. Cool. Where are you?
RANDY :  Hey, what's up?. I'm Randy
YOU 🗣️ :  I got that. Where are you Randy?
RANDY :  I'm in the middle of the party telling everyone what not to do
YOU 🗣️ :  Seems sensible, Randy, I hear there's a murder on the loose
RANDY :  Jesus, this place is packed.
YOU 🗣️ :  Seems kinda dangerous Randy
RANDY :  Sorry.
YOU 🗣️ :  Not your fault. Is that Billy over there?
BILLY :  NO! Don't believe him.
YOU 🗣️ :  Sorry billy, I spotted you. 
BILLY :  The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
YOU 🗣️ :  what do you like to do billy?
BILLY :  I like not kill people, definitely. I'm absolutely trust worthy
YOU 🗣️ :  Good to know, billy. What should we talk about?
BILLY :  I like not kill people, definitely. I'm absolutely trust worthy
YOU 🗣️ :  You already said that, billy. I'm beginning to feel like you're lying
BILLY :  What should we talk about Billy?
YOU 🗣️ :  I'm not Billy
BILLY :  Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
YOU 🗣️ :  Yah, I'm outta this conversation. I feel like I should call the sherriff... dewey
DEWEY :  You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
YOU 🗣️ :  This is a crime scene? What happened Dewey? Also, I'm not tatum. 
DEWEY :  (to Tatum) What are you doing here?
YOU 🗣️ :  Oh, I didn't even see your sister Tatum here dewey
DEWEY :  I'm a Sheriff of Woodsboro
YOU 🗣️ :  I know... Dewey, billy is acting weird
BILLY :  The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
YOU 🗣️ :  See what I mean Dewey? 
DEWEY :  I'm a Sheriff of Woodsboro
YOU 🗣️ :  Dewey, what do you do here? 
DEWEY :  Drive by patrol.
YOU 🗣️ :  Cool, cool cool cool. Hey tatum, is he always this weird?
TATUM :  Your objection is duly noted.
YOU 🗣️ :  No objection, just thought he was acting weird. What do you think Tatum?
TATUM :  I like doing watever I want in the moment
YOU 🗣️ :  Ok Tatum, What do you do here?
TATUM :  Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
YOU 🗣️ :  You think Gale is a twit?
GALE :  During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
YOU 🗣️ :  Wow Tatum, you think Gale is a liar?
GALE :  During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
YOU 🗣️ :  Gale, we heard you the first time
GALE :  The vultures are coming. Let's get you out of here.
YOU 🗣️ :  I don't think I'd like to go with you Gale. 
GALE :  I'm wherever the story is
YOU 🗣️ :  Tatum, how do you feel about her?
TATUM :  No, nothing's like it used to be.
YOU 🗣️ :  Hey Tatum, I don't remember the movie that well, are you dating Stu?
STU :  (offended) What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
YOU 🗣️ :  Stu, that was actually a pretty crazy thing for you to say right then
STU :  Wanna another beer?
YOU 🗣️ :  No, I'm good. But thanks, Stu. 
STU :  What?
